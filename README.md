CHOSEN TRACK: Data Visualization Track
Project Overview
Our project will analyze long-term weather and climate data to identify trends related to climate change. We will focus on temperature, precipitation, possibly sea level rise, frequency of extreme weather events, and other factors to quantify how the climate has changed over time. The insights generated could be applied to environmental policy-making, public awareness campaigns, or resource management. 
Data Collection
Historical Weather Data: Collect historical temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed data from trusted sources.
We are considering one or more of the following data sources:
NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration): Provides global historical weather data, including temperature, precipitation, and sea surface temperatures.
Satellite Data: Use satellite-derived data to monitor trends in sea ice extent, land surface temperatures, or atmospheric CO2 levels NASA GISS (Goddard Institute for Space Studies): Offers temperature anomaly datasets, which highlight deviations from long-term averages.
Berkeley Earth: Provides temperature and other climate data for land and ocean measurements.

Ethical considerations made in the project: Data utilized has been collected by independent scientists who are funded by governmental agencies, universities or foundations. Scientific data is meant to provide an unbiased conclusion about climate change.  

We will consider one or more of the following key metrics to analyze depending on the data availability and ability to complete within one week.
Temperature Trends: (Zaineb)
Global Warming Rate: Track the change in global average temperatures over decades. Calculate anomalies compared to pre-industrial levels.
Regional Temperature Shifts: Focus on temperature changes in specific regions (e.g., Arctic, tropics).

Precipitation Patterns: JT
Rainfall Variability: Analyze how rainfall patterns have changed (more frequent droughts, flooding in certain areas). 
Seasonal Changes: Assess how precipitation during seasons (e.g., monsoon, winter) has shifted.

Extreme Weather Events: Sara
Frequency of Heatwaves: Track the increase in heatwave occurrences globally or in specific regions.
Storm Intensity & Frequency: Analyze data on hurricanes, typhoons, and cyclonesâ€”are they becoming more frequent or intense?
Droughts & Floods: Assess how changing weather patterns have led to more severe droughts or floods in specific regions.

Sea Level Rise: Marco
Global Sea Level: Analyze data on sea level rise, using tide gauge or satellite data.
Coastal Erosion: Examine the impact of rising sea levels on coastal regions.

 Analytical Techniques
Statistical Analysis:
Use time-series analysis to identify significant trends over time.
Correlation and regression analysis to understand the relationship between rising greenhouse gas levels and temperature increases.
Data Visualization:
Temperature Anomaly Maps: Show how average temperatures have deviated from the baseline over time.
Heatmaps: Visualize extreme weather events, temperature fluctuations, or precipitation changes across regions.
Trend Lines: Plot trends of temperature, sea levels, or precipitation over time.
Polar or Circular Plots: Great for visualizing cyclical data such as seasonal temperature variations.
Predictive Modeling:
Linear/Logarithmic Regression Models: Predict future temperature or sea-level rise based on historical data.
Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Holt-Winters): Predict short-term changes based on recent data.
Tools & Technologies & Visualization
Programming Languages:
Python: Libraries like Pandas (data manipulation), NumPy (numerical computing), Matplotlib and Seaborn (data visualization).
Data Storage:
SQL databases to store and query data.
 Potential Insights
Global Warming Trends: Visualize how much the Earth has warmed since the Industrial Revolution and project future warming.
Regional Vulnerability: Highlight regions that are most vulnerable to climate change (e.g., coastal areas prone to flooding, regions suffering from increased drought).
Sea Level Rise Impact: Show potential future sea level rise and how it could affect coastal communities.
Weather Extremes: Track how often extreme weather events (such as hurricanes or heatwaves) have increased and predict future patterns.
Policy Recommendations: Provide data-backed recommendations to mitigate the impact of climate change, such as reducing emissions, adapting infrastructure to rising sea levels, or changing agricultural practices.
 7. Applications & Use Cases
Policy Making: Support climate change policy decisions by providing accurate and updated data on global warming and its impacts.
Public Awareness: Create visualizations to inform the public about the impacts of climate change on their region.
Environmental Impact Assessments: Help environmental organizations track the effectiveness of climate mitigation policies over time.
Climate Adaptation Planning: Provide businesses, governments, and communities with the information needed to adapt to changing climate conditions (e.g., planning for infrastructure projects in coastal areas).
 8. Challenges
Data Quality and Availability: Access to long-term, high-quality data for certain regions may be limited.
Complexity of Climate Systems: Climate change is influenced by numerous factors (e.g., solar radiation, ocean currents), making modeling challenging.
Uncertainty in Projections: Long-term climate projections carry uncertainty, especially when factoring in human intervention (e.g., future emissions reductions).
 9. Outcome
A comprehensive report on the observed trends in climate change over a defined period.
Visualizations showing global and regional temperature changes, sea level rise, and extreme weather event frequencies.
Predictive models that forecast future climate conditions based on current data.
A dashboard or interactive tool that policymakers, businesses, or the general public can use to explore climate change impacts.
This project could generate valuable insights into how climate change is already affecting the planet and what we can expect in the future.
